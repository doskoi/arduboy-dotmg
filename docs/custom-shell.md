# Custom dotMG Shells

If you'd like to change up the shell from the PCB-based one, this repo contains SVG and EPS files under the [`shell`](/shell) directory for laser-cutting your own. Use these to upload to a laser-cutting service (e.g. [Ponoko](https://ponoko.com)) or cut with your own laser cutter.

Below are some tips to keep in mind when ordering or setting up your equipment.

## Color Layers

Each file is comprised of two color layers:
- **Light gray/purple:** Cutting
- **Dark gray:** Engraving

> For a simpler look (or to save money on laser-cutting services) you can ignore the engraving layer when ordering or setting up your equipment.

## Dimensions

Double check that your part dimensions will come out as follows:
- **dotMG**: 73.9mm (width) x 87.2mm (height)
- **dotMG Advance**: 121.1mm (width) x 55.9mm (height)

## Thickness

The recommended part thickness is 1.5-2.0mm (preferably 1.5mm). This is most important for the front shell, as too much thickness will impact the ability to press the buttons.
